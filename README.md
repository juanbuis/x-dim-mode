Chrome extension that restores the Dim (dark blue) background option to X/Twitter display settings.

## What it does

X removed the Dim background option from Display settings. This extension brings it back.

- Adds a **Dim** button to Settings → Display → Background
- Quick toggle from the extension popup
- Pure CSS — lightweight and fast

## Install

### Chrome Web Store (recommended)
**[Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/x-dim-mode/cplloghlcgkjkogmbehmkhlleopnfogc)** — one click to install, updates automatically.

### Manual install (takes 30 seconds)
1. [Download this repo as a ZIP](https://github.com/juanbuis/x-dim-mode/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in your browser
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the unzipped `x-dim-mode-main` folder
6. Go to [x.com/settings/display](https://x.com/settings/display) — you'll see **Dim** is back as a background option

## How it works

The extension layers the original Dim theme colors on top of Lights Out mode using CSS overrides. It also injects a "Dim" radio button into X's Display settings page so you can switch themes natively.
